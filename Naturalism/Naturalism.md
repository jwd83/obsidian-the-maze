The view that [[cosmos|nature]] is all that exists. We do not now know, nor do I expect we will in my lifetime begin to completely comprehend the full extent of nature.

>You see, one thing is I can live with doubt, uncertainty and not knowing. I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here and what the question might mean. I might think about it a little bit If I can't figure it out then I go on to something else. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell possibly, it doesn't frighten me.
