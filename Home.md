# Welcome to The Maze

A collection of my thoughts and notes as life long [[Programming Languages|computer programmer]] and [[Naturalism|naturalist]].

Some of my favorite writers include [[Jacob Bronowski]], [[Sam Harris]], [[Lawrence M. Krauss]], [[Richard Dawkins]] & [[Carl Sagan]].

I started this project in 2023 to categorize my own knowledge and root out it's weak points.

The markdown for this site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jwd83/obsidian-the-maze).
