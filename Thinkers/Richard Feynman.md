I think Feynman may be the most brilliant, insightful and influential scientist since [[Albert Einstein]]. Unified several forces of nature into a single theory - [[Quantum Electrodynamics]].

The book [[Quantum Man]] by [[Lawrence M. Krauss ]] tells the story of Feynman's life and contributions to science. 

There are video recordings of Feynman near the end of his life where he talks about his views on the world and nature.

>You see, one thing is I can live with doubt, uncertainty and not knowing. I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here and what the question might mean. I might think about it a little bit If I can't figure it out then I go on to something else. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell possibly, it doesn't frighten me.
