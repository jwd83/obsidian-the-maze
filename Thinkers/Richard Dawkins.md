A zoologist and writer who I had the pleasure to meet in person twice. He coined the term "[[Meme]]" in his book [[The Selfish Gene]]. 

## Books

I've finished quite a Richard's books. Here are some of those:

[[The Selfish Gene]] - The book where he coins the term [[Meme]]
[[The God Delusion]]
[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]
[[An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist]]

## Meeting Richard
The first at the reason rally in Washington, DC and again during a talk given in DC where I was able to grab a photo with him.
