TCP, short for Transmission Control Protocol, is an [[IP]] based protocol is like a reliable delivery service for your internet data. It makes sure all the information you send or receive on the internet gets to the right place without getting lost or mixed up, and if something goes wrong, TCP asks for the information to be sent again. Comparatively [[UDP]] does not care or know about packet loss nor the order of arrival.
