UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is another way to send data over the internet, but unlike [[TCP]], it doesn't double-check if everything got delivered correctly. It's like sending a letter without tracking â€” faster because it doesn't wait for confirmations, but there's no guarantee everything reached its destination intact and in the order it was sent.

It's commonly used in games where sending a client the freshest information possible is paramount.
