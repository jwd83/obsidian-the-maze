I started writing this in highschool?

I remember my first big personal project in PHP being a website for the MMO game [[Motor City Online]] my clan Detroit Lubricators. We stored car setups here for people in our clan to reference. We typically held the weekly records most weeks on our server.

I went on to do the website for powertrain control solutions, ballenger motorsports and iofast in PHP. They were built on phpbb, oscommerce, wordpress and my own bespoke projects.
