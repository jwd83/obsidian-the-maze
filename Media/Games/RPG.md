A role playing game. Final fantasy 1 for the NES was my first experience of this type of game, though Final Fantasy 2 for the SNES was my first time really delving into the genre hard and completing this type of game. Many more games include RPG elements as time has gone on.

Some of my favorite RPG's series include...

[[Final Fantasy]]
[[Diablo]]
[[World of Warcraft]]
[[Dragon Quest]]
[[Dark Souls]] / [[Elden Ring]]
[[Baldur's Gate]]
