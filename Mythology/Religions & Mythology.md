I view religion and mythology as one in the same.

[[Karen Armstrong]]'s [[The History of God]] has a great deal of information on humanities transition from polytheism to monotheism and provides a timeline of authors and edits to the bible supported by evidence and the majority of religious studies professors, archeologists and anthropologists.

The YouTube channel evidence has s great video series on a fundamentalists conversion to [[Atheism]]. The series features a [summary of Karen's book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnnWbkMlbg). 

The Enuma Elish found in the Library of Ashurbanipa and dated to around 1750 [[BCE]] shows a world in the thralls of [[Polytheism]] and no trace of [[Monotheism]] and features the [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] Babylonian creation myth.

Monotheism seems to rise around 600 [[BCE]].

Many passages of the bible were originally written in a polytheistic world view and have been edited by subsequent authors into a more [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] mythology however it's [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] routes can still be found dripping over pages in the old testament.
