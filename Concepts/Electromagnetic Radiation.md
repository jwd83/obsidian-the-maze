Electromagnetic radiation is (packets/quanta) or waves of energy that propagates throughout the universe. Some of the most distant radiation we can detect is that of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation]] (CMBR). It is leftover heat from the [[The Big Bang]] that is [[red shifting]] away from us via to the [[expansion of the universe]]. It appears to be largely uniform and random. Several surveys have been performed of the CMBR and can be found online.
