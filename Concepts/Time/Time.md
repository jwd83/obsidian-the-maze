Aside from being one of my favorite songs by [[Pink Floyd]], time is a difficult concept to understand. It appears to only move in one direction; however; [[Electron]] [[Positron]] pairs appear to somewhat invalidate this premise. The book [[A Universe from Nothing]] by [[Lawrence M. Krauss]] has an excellent chapter discussing this.

Properly dealing with time in [[Programming Languages]] can be tricky. I generally find the simplest way to store time is via a [[UNIX]] timestmap.
