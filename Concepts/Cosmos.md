In the words of the late, great [[Carl Sagan]]...

Our universe and all things in it. Unimaginably vast. There are in excess of a hundred billion [[Galaxy|galaxies]] in our observable universe each containing possibly a hundred billion [[Star|stars]] or more.  Our Sun is just one single grain of sand in the vast cosmic desert. 

Current estimates put the number of stars in the observable universe in the rage of 70 septillion. Compare this to the estimated number of grains of sand on earth at 7 sextillion and it's clear we would need roughly 10,000 earths worth of sand to be in the ballpark of sand grains to stars. There is no sense to be made of these numbers.
