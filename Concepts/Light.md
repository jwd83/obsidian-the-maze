Light - Is it a wave or is a particle? Is it both?  The wave-particle duality is a principal of light in that it appears to act as both a wave and a particle. Light is said to travel in quanta or packets of energy. [[Humans]] tend to think of light as only [[Visible Light]] but  it is only a portion of the broader [[Electromagnetic Spectrum]].
