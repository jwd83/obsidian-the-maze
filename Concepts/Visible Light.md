Visible Light is a form of  [[Electromagnetic Radiation]] that features a wavelength that is in the visible range for [[human vision]]. Note that is is only a single region of the broader [[Electromagnetic Spectrum]] whose full breadth is (nearly?) infinite. Visible light is simply a different frequency, or wavelength, of the same spectrum that all wireless technology operates on from WiFi, Bluetooth and Zigbee.
