Protons are at the center of an atom and thought to be positively charged. They are made of of smaller fundamental particles such as quarks popping in out of existence  as well as a boiling, bubbling brew of [[empty space]]. A video of the simulation of the inside of a proton was shown at the [[Nobel Prize]] ceremony in the early 2000s.
