Estimating your Total Daily Energy Expenditure is as simple as calculating your [[BMR]] and multiplying it by your TDEE activity level multiplier.

Approximate TDEE Multiplier | Activity Level
--|--:
1.2|points for a person who does little to no exercise
1.375|points for a slightly active person who does light exercise 1–3 days a week
1.55|points for a moderately active person who performs moderate exercise 3–5 days a week
1.725|points for a very active person who exercises hard 6–7 days a week
1.9|points for an extra active person who either has a physically demanding job or has a particularly challenging exercise routine


Assuming you have a BMR of 1750 and your activity level is a TDEE value of 1.2 your approximate daily caloric burn is...
$$
\begin{align}
\text{TDEE}&=\text{BMR} * \text{TDEE Multiplier}\\
\text{TDEE}&=1750 * 1.2\\
\text{TDEE}&=2100
\end{align}
